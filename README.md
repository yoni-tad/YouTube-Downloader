# YouTube Video Downloader (GUI)

This is a simple Python desktop application with a GUI for downloading multiple YouTube videos at once.

It started as a personal project when my father asked me to download many videos for him. Instead of doing it manually one by one, I decided to build a small app that can handle a list of links at once.

- Paste multiple YouTube links at once (one per line)

## üíª Building an .exe (for Windows)
If you want to make a standalone .exe so others can use it without installing Python:

```bash
auto-py-to-exe
```
- Choose your script (main.py)
- Select Onefile
- Add an icon if you want
- Click Convert .py to .exe

‚úÖ The output .exe can be shared and run on any Windows machine (no need for Python).
